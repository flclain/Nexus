To make it easier to get started, we've prepared a basic pipeline that guides users from data caching to data generation and visualization. 

Please refer to [pipeline.py](../scripts/generation/pipeline.py) after downloading the nuPlan dataset and the corresponding checkpoint (paths to checkpoints can be found in [train_eval.md](./train_eval.md)).
